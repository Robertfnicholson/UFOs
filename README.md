# UFOs Challenge â€“ 
## Overview of Project
Using JavaScript, built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Created filters to make this table fully 
dynamic, meaning that it reacts to user input, and then placed this table into an HTML file for easy viewing. 
Customized the webpage using Bootstrap and equipped this table with several fully functional filters that allow 
users to interact with my visualizations through added functionality in which users can filter this dynamic table 
by multiple criteria at the same time.  I replaced the handleclick() function in the app.js file with a new function 
that saves the element, value, and id of the filter that was changed. Then, I created a new function to loop through 
the dataset and keep only the results that match the search criteria. The dynamic table on the webpage will be updated 
with the search criteria after pressing "Enter. My code can be found in index.html, app.js, and style.css. </p>

## Results
A user of the webpage is able to search the dynamic table using multiple criteria. The dynamic table on the webpage 
will be updated with the search criteria after the user presses "enter." The first image below displays the unfiltered 
table that a user finds when the user opens the webpage. The second image below displays a filtered table with the 
filter criteria indicated and the console that displays the filter id and the filter value for each filter. To return 
to the unfiltered table, just refresh the browser. </p>

## Summary
One drawback of the webpage is the limited and dated data from the data.js file. I recommend updating the data with 
the latest information available. I would also recommend adding any images that are available of sitings to the table, 
making it even more interactive.
